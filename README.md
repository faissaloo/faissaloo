I'm Faissaloo, I'm Muslim. I started writing code back in 2010 with Game Maker 8.  
  
I use an Entroware Apollo running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and write code in [Atom](https://atom.io/).
My favourite programming language is [D](https://dlang.org/), but I also greatly enjoy writing [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), [C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1fISh-pag) and [x86 Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language).
