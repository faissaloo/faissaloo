I'm Faissaloo, I'm Muslim. I started writing code back in 2010 with Game Maker 8.  
I generally try to write code I'm personally interested in making use of because it's very difficult to assess how good something is if you're not personally using it.  
I'm critical of the unfettered advancement of technology and I try to make the most out of older hardware that's already floating about since it's often more than adequate for the job.
  
I use an Entroware Apollo running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and write code in [Atom](https://atom.io/).
My favourite programming language is [D](https://dlang.org/), but I also greatly enjoy writing [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), [C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S1fISh-pag) and [x86 Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language).
